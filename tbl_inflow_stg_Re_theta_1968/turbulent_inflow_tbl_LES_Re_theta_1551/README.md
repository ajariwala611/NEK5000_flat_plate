# ZPG Turbulent Boundary Layer with Synthetic Turbulent Inflow starting at Re_theta = 1551

The inflow condition is an implementation of ["Synthetic Turbulence Generators for RANS-LES Interfaces in Zonal Simulations of Aerodynamic and Aeroacoustic Problems"](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10494-014-9534-8.pdf) by Shur et al.

The turbulent boundary layer profiles are from [Jimenez's database](https://torroja.dmt.upm.es/turbdata/blayers/low_re/).
